# UrgencyDDMonSpecies

This code plots all the figures in the paper with the title "Of rodents and primates: Time-variant gain in drift-diffusion decision models."
## Python and PyDDM 
To fit models, PyDDM package 0.7.0 must be installed.

For each species, the code for fitting time-variant urgency DDM is included within Human, Monkey, and rat folders.
## MATLAB codes
To run MATLAB codes, Python should be configured for MATLAB.

Run plot_within_species_figures.m within the Matlab Code folder to plot Figs 2-4 in the paper.

Run plot_between_species_figures.m within the Matlab Code folder to plot Fig 5 in the paper.
