# UrgencyDDMonSpecies

This code plots all the figures in the paper with the title "Of rodents and primates: Time-variant gain in drift-diffusion decision models."

For each species, the code for fitting urgency DDM using the pyDDM package is included within Human, Monkey, and rat folders.

Run plot_within_species_figures.m within the Matlab Code folder to plot Figs 2-4 in the paper.

Run plot_between_species_figures.m within the Matlab Code folder to plot Fig 5 in the paper.
